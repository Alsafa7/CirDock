# CirDock
By now you'd probably known what it is because you were probably redirected here from that placed... But, nonetheless, CirDock is a tweak that evolutionizes your ios device by introducing a dock that allows for a lot of versatility.

##NOTE:
I tried to document the code as well as I could but please don't judge me. :P I learn every day :D

### Features that still need to be added:
**(You can help add these if you want :D )**
- Allow the dock to autohide
- Add folders
- allow for theme-ability
- RoundDock compatibility
- ability to add icons by drag-and-drop
- add a new dock layout named paged which locks a certain number of icons on each section and the user can navigate through them
- Restore dock apps upon uninstall
- Remove app icons from home-screen if enabled (no duplicates. This should be switchable, aka on/off)
- create different hold actions and name them what we want.
- Apex 2 Compatibility
- app name display above icon
- CallBar compatibility
- Classic Dock compatibility
- Make it so that the linear type will stop scrolling at the edges and doesnt scroll to the centre
- Multiple lists of favourites (can also be the representation of "folders")
- SBTouch Button compatibility
- Open dock in another app without returning to springboard
- Harbor Compatibility
- Snap to icons feature
- Ability  to enable/disable tweak
- Add tweak plugins to enable some special code to be displayed instead of the dock. EG: a music player plugin so that when activated, the music player UI replaces the dock's UI, etc...
